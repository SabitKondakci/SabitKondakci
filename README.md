# Sabit KondakÃ§Ä±

Merhaba, I've been spending my time on algorithms, math, physics, statistics since 2010, loving to be on my computer to design something newfangled.

I graduated from university, bachelor of engineering physics in 2015, later decided to proceed further with software, where I defined myself as full-stack developer which fits right in for my qualifications.
